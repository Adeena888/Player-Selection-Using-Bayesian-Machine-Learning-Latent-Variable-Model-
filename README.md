# Player Selection Using Bayesian Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Selecting the right players based on performance data is challenging due to uncertainty and hidden factors that are not directly observable.  
This project uses a Bayesian Machine Learning approach with latent variables to estimate player effectiveness and support selection decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical player performance metrics used to evaluate selection probability.
